This unity project can play pano videos.
The video is attached to a video sphere with video player. 
The camera is placed at the center of the sphere, and can rotate/zoom to see video.
The sphere's material neeed to use "Flip normals" shader, so the video is played from the inside of the video.

Since the shader is flipped, the video source also needed to be flipped, so the viwer can see the correct video.
